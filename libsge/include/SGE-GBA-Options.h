//! Compilation options
//! Notes:
//!  -NOTELUT_BITS defines the resolution between each semitone of the lookup
//!   table used to convert a note value into a frequency value. A value of 0
//!   is only exact to the semitone (up to rounding), with all fine-tuning
//!   being linearly interpolated between the semitones (0.775 cents RMSE).
//!   Increasing this value reduces the error by 75% per step - by introducing
//!   more values in between the semitones -, at the cost of doubling the size
//!   of the lookup table, but execution time remains constant.
//!   Possible values, and their resulting RMSE and lookup table size:
//!    0: 0.775 cents RMSE,  52 bytes
//!    1: 0.194 cents RMSE, 100 bytes
//!    2: 0.048 cents RMSE, 196 bytes
//!    3: 0.012 cents RMSE, 388 bytes
//!    4: 0.003 cents RMSE, 772 bytes
//!  -VARIABLE_SYNC_RATE will perform mixing in chunks of length specified
//!   during the driver initialization. This allows updates rates other than
//!   the native rate of ~60Hz, but adds a non-neglibile amount of CPU load
//!   due to needing to calculate envelope values dynamically, plus overhead
//!   from the update routines.
//!   This mode will make use of a reciprocals table, declared as:
//!    RecpLUT_t SGE_RecpLUT[256]
//!   where RecpLUT_t depends on RECPLUT_BITS:
//!    RECPLUT_BITS == 8:  uint8_t
//!    RECPLUT_BITS == 16: uint16_t
//!    RECPLUT_BITS == 32: uint32_t
//!   This is then paired with RECPLUT_PRECISION to define the lookup table.
//!   Note that for correct functioning, the entry corresponding to 1/x for
//!   x==1 must equal 2^PRECISION-1, or overflow may result.
//!   The library defines this table, but it is declared as weak so that it
//!   can be overriden by a user-defined reciprocals table.
//!  -BPM_FRACBITS controls the accuracy of the BPM counter for music. When
//!   the update rate is low enough, it is strongly recommended to set this
//!   to 0. However, with a high enough update rate, this can be set to a
//!   maximum value of 5. Note that high precision can cause 'skipping' in
//!   music output, which is why it should only be used with high update rates.
//!  -STEREO_WAVEFORMS enables global support for stereo waveforms. This will
//!   add a large amount of code in RAM, but allows direct mixing of stereo
//!   waveforms in optimized mixing loops instead of using separate voices.
//!  -USE_CURVED_ATTACK bends the attack curve to use a reverse-quadratic
//!   curve (that is: 1-(1-x)^2 = 2*x-x^2). This can sound more natural.
//!  -EG1_LOG2THRESHOLD defines the threshold below which a voice will be
//!   killed when in the Decay or Release phase.
//!  -LFO_RAMP_FREQ enables ramping of the LFO frequency over the delay time,
//!   and LFO_RAMP_AMP enables ramping of the LFO amplitude over the delay
//!   time. Note that these options only apply when a waveform articulation
//!   is using the ramping feature.
//!  -VOLFRACBITS refers to extra precision bits to preserve during mixing.
//!   These will be chopped during the final mix, but can alter the output.
//!   For example, a value of 4 will mix in 12bit precision before being
//!   chopped to 8bit during mixdown.
//!  -USE_VOLSUBDIV enables subdivision of the mixing chunk (up to a target
//!   volume level, or length) to avoid harsh volume transitions with larger
//!   mixing chunks. It will slightly increase CPU, but may greatly reduce
//!   envelope-related crackling. This option is used in conjunction with the
//!   VOLSUBDIV_MINLENGTH (smallest subdivision length) option, as well as the
//!   VOLSUBDIV_LOG2RATIO (largest allowed volume ratio per update, expressed
//!   as its base-2 logarithm; eg. 2 is 1/4 volume step ratio) option.
//!   Note: As a limitation of GBA mixing unsigned samples, subdivision is
//!   limited to a certain number of steps N, where N is specified via the
//!   VOLSUBDIV_LOG2MAXSUBDIV option (eg. 0 = No subdivision, 1 = 1/2, etc.),
//!   and the buffer sizes must be divisible by the maximum subdivision.
//!  -FAST_INTERPOLATE uses a faster interpolation method where available,
//!   at the cost of reduced quality output. This may be either from a
//!   reduction in the sample bit-depth, interpolation accuracy, or both.
//!   Note that not all mixing cores support this option.
//!  -USE_OVERSAMPLING uses linear interpolation to upsample the direct
//!   output signal to compensate for the typically imperfect sampling rates
//!   used on the GBA. This adds an extra CPU and RAM cost, but the audio
//!   will generally sound far less aliased, at the cost of some muffling;
//!   this can be compensated by using a high-shelf filter on the waveforms.
//!  -USE_CLIPPING will clip the audio signal if the amplitude is exceeded.
//!   It is strongly recommended to use this, unless you carefully test the
//!   output of the mixer to ensure overflow does not happen.
//!   Note that any overflows will propagate into the reverb output.
//!  -PCM8_MONO_UNROLL and PCM8_STEREO_UNROLL control loop unrolling for the
//!   inner mixing loops. Increasing the unroll count can potentially lead
//!   to much better performance, but will add a lot of code in RAM.
//!   Any samples left after the unrolled block will be mixed in a
//!   one-sample-per-iteration loop.

//! Reverb-specific compilation options
//! Notes:
//!  -ALLPASS_BITS controls the accuracy of the all-pass filter buffers.
//!   When this is > 8, the all-pass filter buffers will use 16-bit data
//!   buffers, which will double the memory consumption, but will result
//!   in much cleaner audio, with reduced hiss/noise in the reverb tail.
//!   Using "fancy" reverb with any value greater than 8 adds a 4c/sample
//!   penalty during final mixdown to apply scaling and rounding. Using a
//!   value of 7 will add a lot of hiss/noise to the output, but should
//!   minimize the need to apply clipping to the all-pass output and avoid
//!   most 'crackly' artifacts resulting from clipping.
//!  -CLIP_ALLPASS will clip the intermediate output of the reverb all-pass
//!   filters to ensure no overflow. The intermediate is formed as:
//!    u[t] = x[t] +/- u[t-N]
//!   which may cause overflows if left unchecked. However, at intermediate
//!   output levels, this is rarely necessary, and can easily be left out.
//!   This option only has any effect when ALLPASS_BITS is <= 8; when using
//!   high-precision buffers, clipping becomes impossible, and so the number
//!   of bits in ALLPASS_BITS is limited to 14 at most to avoid the need to
//!   apply any clipping at all.
#define SGE_ALLPASS_BITS 14 //! 7 = Minimum precision, 14 = Maximum precision (see notes)
#define SGE_CLIP_ALLPASS  0 //! 0 = Don't clip reverb all-pass output, 1 = Clip output
