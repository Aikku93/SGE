//! SGE_Driver_GetMixingBufferSizeDefault(RateHz)
//! Description: Get size of the mixing buffer for given parameters.
//! Arguments:
//!   RateHz: Sampling rate (in Hz).
//! Returns: Size in bytes of a mixing buffer to suit RateHz.
//! Notes:
//!  -Returns 0 if RateHz is an unsupported sampling rate.
//!  -This assumes that the driver is using the native update rate.
SGE_DECLSPEC uint32_t SGE_Driver_GetMixingBufferSizeDefault(uint16_t RateHz);

//! SGE_Driver_GetWorkAreaSizeDefault(VoxCnt, BufCnt, RateHz)
//! Description: Get size of SGE_Driver_t structure for given parameters.
//! Arguments:
//!   VoxCnt: Number of voices.
//!   BufCnt: Number of output buffers.
//!   RateHz: Sampling rate (in Hz).
//! Returns: Size in bytes of a SGE_Driver_t structure to suit the parameters.
//! Notes:
//!  -Returns 0 if the requested parameters cannot form a valid driver.
//!  -This assumes that the driver is using the native update rate.
SGE_DECLSPEC uint32_t SGE_Driver_GetWorkAreaSizeDefault(uint8_t VoxCnt, uint8_t BufCnt, uint16_t RateHz);

//! SGE_Driver_InitDefault(Driver, VoxCnt, RateHz, BufCnt, MixBuf)
//! Description: Initialize SGE driver at the default update rate.
//! Arguments:
//!   Driver: Driver work area.
//!   VoxCnt: Number of voices.
//!   RateHz: Sampling rate (in Hz).
//!   BufCnt: Number of output buffers.
//!   MixBuf: Assigned mixing buffer (see SGE_Driver_GetMixingBufferSizeDefault()).
//! Returns: On success, returns a non-zero value. On failure, returns 0.
//! Notes:
//!  -BufCnt must be between 2 and 255.
//!  -MixBuf must be aligned to 4 bytes.
//!  -This routine automatically enables the audio hardware.
//!  -When using reverb, pre-delay is equal to the total buffer size.
//! GBA-specific notes:
//!  -The default update rate is 59.7275Hz, corresponding to VSync timings.
//!  -It is only possible to have one driver open at any time. Multiple drivers
//!   can be initialized, but only one can be active at any given time.
//!  -The driver takes over DMA channels 1+2 and a timer (see SGE_HWTIMER_IDX).
//!  -The buffer sizes are set for a frame's worth of FIFO samples:
//!     BufLen = Round[RateHz * AGB_FRAME_CYCLES/AGB_HW_FREQ_HZ]
//!   Additionally, note that BufLen*BufCnt must be a multiple of 16, or this
//!   function will return an error (the audio hardware fetches in 16-sample
//!   units). Some RateHz,BufCnt configurations that will work:
//!    BufCnt=2,3,4... @ 13379Hz
//!    BufCnt=2,4,6... @ 15768Hz <- BufCnt multiples of 2!
//!    BufCnt=2,3,4... @ 18157Hz
//!    BufCnt=2,3,4... @ 20068Hz
//!    BufCnt=2,3,4... @ 21024Hz
//!    BufCnt=2,3,4... @ 26758Hz <- Can't use SGE_USE_OVERSAMPLING!
//!    BufCnt=2,4,6... @ 27236Hz <- BufCnt multiples of 2!
//!    BufCnt=2,3,4... @ 31536Hz
//!    BufCnt=2,4,6... @ 36792Hz <- BufCnt multiples of 2!
//!    BufCnt=2,3,4... @ 40137Hz
//!    BufCnt=2,3,4... @ 42048Hz
//!   26758Hz cannot be used with oversampling because the timer period is
//!   narrowed from 313.5 cycles to 313 cycles, causing desynchronization.
//!  -The return value of this function is actually the timer period:
//!     Period = Round[AGB_HW_FREQ_HZ / RateHz]
//!   Note that with oversampling, the period is that of RateHz*2.
//! NDS-specific notes:
//!  -The default update rate is 59.8246Hz, approximately equal to VSync timing,
//!   with some rounding error (this should be 59.8261Hz). Although this is
//!   intended for relatively consistent timing, it is not perfectly aligned to
//!   VSync, and it is necessary to keep track of the update timing.
//!  -It is possible to have multiple drivers open at any time, provided that
//!   they are all continuously updated and allocated to hardware voices.
//!  -BufLen*BufCnt must be a multiple of 2. As BufLen is dependent on RateHz
//!   and the update rate, it may be necessary to experiment. Having said that,
//!   some RateHz that will work are: 16364Hz, 24546Hz, 32728Hz (recommended).
//!  -This function, as well as SGE_Driver_Init() and SGE_Driver_Resume(), will
//!   invoke SGE_Usercall_BeginStream() to begin playback; this function is
//!   user-defined for the purposes of portability.

//! SGE_Driver_Sync(Driver)
//! Description: Synchronize hardware playback.
//! Arguments:
//!   Driver: Driver work area.
//! Returns: Nothing; playback synchronized.
//! Notes:
//!  -Because the GBA doesn't loop sound buffers automatically, this function
//!   is needed to reset the DMA stream upon reaching the end of buffer.
//!  -Timing of this function is EXTREMELY critical (leeway of 1596 cycles

//!   this function is called that matters, but rather the consistency of
//!   the timing. For best results, it should work best to call this function
//!   as soon as the interrupt handler passes control to the user function,
//!   as this should have guaranteed consistent timing.

//!  Length: Length of each buffer (in samples).
//!  RateHz: Intended playback rate of the stream.
//! Returns: This function must return NULL on failure, or a "stream token" to
//! associate the stream with on success. This token can be any value that will
//! fit in a void* type, and will be passed to SGE_Usercall_StopStream().
//! Notes:

//!   any portion of updating or streaming, and only synthesizes the output
//!   audio to buffers.
