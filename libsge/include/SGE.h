//!  -SGE_PLATFORM_IS_64BIT

//! Platform-specific type definitions:
//!  -SGE_MixSmp_t
//!  -SGE_OutSmp_t
//!  -struct SGE_Driver_Platform_t {}
//! Notes:
//!  -If SGE_Driver_Platform_t is not needed, it must explicitly contain
//!   no data (eg. `int Dummy[0]`), as otherwise g++ may interpret it to
//!   contain `char[1]`, which will break assumptions in C/C++ code.
//!   Note that the structure must be aligned to the size of a pointer;
//!   see the definition of SGE_PTRALIGNED for an example.
//!  -FANCY_REVERB applies a low-pass filter at every delay line to add
//!   absorption to each reflection, giving a much more realistic effect.
//!   This effect adds more CPU load, and the reverb's low-pass cutoff
//!   parameter will need to be increased to account for it.
//!  -To expose internal functions and parameters, define SGE_INTERNALS.

//! Reverb parameter structure [10h bytes]
/*!
  Explanation of parameters
  -------------------------
  nTapLines:
    Desired number of taps. The higher this value is, the more natural the
    reverb sounds, at the cost of more processing power being required.
    Format: Raw integer.
  RoomDensity:
    Controls the reverb reflection characteristics. The larger the value, the
    more "boxed-in" the sound. Conversely, smaller values give a more
    diffuse-sounding output. Note that if this is set too low, the reverb
    initialization routines may fail as the reflections become too sparse.
    Format: 0.8fxp normalized units (eg. FFh = 99%)
  StereoWidth:
    Alters the reflection times for L/R channels to increase the stereo image.
    Larger values give more exaggerated differences.
    Format: 8.8fxp milliseconds (eg. 1000h = 16.0ms)
  DecayTime:
    Controls the length of the reverb tail. Larger values sound very spacious,
    but can be prone to ringing when combined with a high feedback level.
    This refers to the time it takes for the reverb to decay by 60dB (ie. the
    standardized RT_60 specification).
    Format: 8.8fxp seconds (eg. 2000h = 32.0s)
  Feedback:
    Feedback level for reverb. Higher values result in a more "open" sound, but
    can be prone to ringing when paired with a small number of taps and/or high
    lowpass cutoff frequency.
    Format: 8.8fxp dB attenuation (eg. 600h = -6.0dB)
  LowpassHz:
    -3dB point for the lowpass filters. Lower values give a more "muffled" and
    absorbant reverb, while high values give a more "brilliant" and open sound.
    IMPORTANT: When using "simple" reverb, this lowpass cutoff is accurate.
    However, when using "fancy" reverb, this cutoff needs to be warped, as the
    series lowpass filters will cause a shift in the cutoff frequency.
    Specifically, the cutoff point can be translated via:
      FancyCutoffHz  = RateHz/2 * (SimpleCutoffHz * 2/RateHz)^(1/nTapLines)
      SimpleCutoffHz = RateHz/2 * (FancyCutoffHz  * 2/RateHz)^nTapLines
    Format: Hertz.
  RateHz:
    Sampling rate of processing. This affects the calculations of the reverb
    line sizes and lowpass coefficient, but does not affect the feedback level.
    Format: Hertz.
